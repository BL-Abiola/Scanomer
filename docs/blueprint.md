## Core Features:

- QR Code Classification: Classify the QR code type based on its content (e.g., Website, Payment, Wi-Fi, Contact, Email, Phone, App Download, File, Unknown).
- Semantic Signaling: Assign a 'Signal Color' (Emerald, Indigo, Amber, Amethyst, Crimson) based on content analysis to indicate the level of potential risk or complexity associated with the QR code content.
- Root Domain Extraction: Extract the root domain from website URLs within the QR code content to provide clarity about the destination.
- Variable Identification: Identify hidden variables, tracking IDs, and obscured paths present in the QR code content to highlight potential tracking or redirection.
- Action Preview: Provide a clear, neutral description of the immediate action the operating system will perform upon opening the QR code (e.g., 'Open browser', 'Add contact').
- Output Structure: Presents structured insights (QR code type, signal color, neutral content explanation, immediate action description, and awareness points regarding tracking or redirection).
